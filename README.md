# labasi-lab
a repo to explore data from the labasi-project

## Task 1: Get to know the data

Gather basic statics about the data like:

* How many Glyphs | Sings | Tablets
* How many Glyphs per Sign | Tablet (total numbers, mean, min, max)
* Glyphs per Period | Scribe | ... (total numbers, mean, min, max)

Visualize your results with e.g. bar charts


## Task 2: Define what you'd like to train

Based on the outcome of Task 1 define potential use cases for training specific classifier/models
e.g. Train a model to classify
* Glyphs by Period
* Glyphs by Tablet
* Glyphs by Sign


## Task 3: Feature definition

It is most likely necessary to somehow numberize the images of the traning data. This will involve some image (pre)processing, e.g. removing color, scale, rotate, cut, ....
